# ðŸ”¬ OpenGL Experiments ðŸ”¬

This project contains a few examples of working with ModernGL.

## Playground

![playground showcase video](doc/playground.gif)

The playground script renders a few basic shapes in different colors. 
One of the shapes is animated (animation can be paused by pressing  `space`)

You can move around in the scene with your mouse and WASD. Also, you can use `OrbitCameraWindow` in the code to enable
an orbit camera.

## Teapot

The teapot script renders a teapot model with porcelain texture and phong lighting model.
You can press `space` to pause the animation and `f` to toggle the phong lighting fragment shader.

## WIP

Scripts under the `src/wip` directory are work in progress and may not work.
